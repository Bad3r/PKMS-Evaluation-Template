## Introduction
---
The goal of this Personal Knowledge Mangment System (PKMS) evaluation template is to help professionals in the tech field to find the best Personal Knowledge Management System (PKMS) for their needs and preferences. This template can be used to evaluate multiple knowledge management systems, and provides a structured and systematic approach to comparing and contrasting the different systems based on key criteria, such as performance, usability, cost, support and maintenance, scalability and flexibility, community and ecosystem, and other factors. By following the steps and answering the questions in this template, users can make informed and well-considered decisions on which PKMS to use.

The template is designed to be customizable and adaptable, and users can add or remove criteria, or modify the steps and questions, to better suit their specific goals and requirements.
